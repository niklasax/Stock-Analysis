# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this Analysis was to gain functional understanding of VBA. In this particular example, we used vba to help Steve, a recent Finance Graduate, help his parents evaluate the performance of Green Energy stock data from 2017 and 2018.

## Results
(Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.)

## Summary
(What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?)
